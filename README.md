Powering the website - www.rajath.in

Create your own website using the below steps after cloning this repo : 
```
npm install
npm start
```

A local server is run at http://localhost:3000/ and any changes made are automatically reflected on the local server on save.

Alternatively you can use :
`npm run build` - create the dist folder

Host the contents from your `dist` folder.

This is based on a theme created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).
